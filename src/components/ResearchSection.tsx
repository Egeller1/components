      <h2>User Research Approach</h2>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "2.3rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        To better understand real-world printer challenges, we sought out Brown
        University students and asked them questions while they were actively
        using the printer.
      </p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: "2.3rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
        Our primary goal was to capture genuine reactions and frustrations in
        context, rather than relying on hypothetical scenarios.

          Can you describe your experience the first time you used the school
          printer system?

        <li style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>
          For a first-time user, how easy or difficult was it to understand how
          to use the printer system?
        </li>
        <li style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>
          Could you walk me through the steps you take from logging in on the
          school Wi-Fi to swiping your card?
        </li>
        <li style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>
          How clear were the instructions you received (or found) when
          connecting to the school Wi-Fi?
        </li>
        <li style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>
          When multiple print jobs show up, how do you know which one to select
          or cancel?

        <li style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>
          What challenges or frustrations have you encountered while using the
          printer interface?

          How do you feel when you use this printer system? Why?
        </li>
        <li style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>
          If you could change one thing about the printer interface, what would
          it be and why?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With these questions in hand, we proceeded to observe and record the
        participantsâ€™ interactions and experiences.
